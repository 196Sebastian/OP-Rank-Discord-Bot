# ðŸŒŸ Project Description
I've developed an innovative rank bot on Discord for the One Piece card game. This dynamic bot excels in game initiation, providing users with a seamless setup process for various gaming scenarios. The challenge initiation module, tailored to consider voice channel constraints, enhances user engagement, ensuring a smooth transition into the gaming experience. Its sophisticated result reporting system ensures accurate representation of game outcomes through user reactions and confirmation mechanisms. A standout feature is the implementation of an Elo-based leaderboard, showcasing my deep understanding of gaming mechanics and user interactions by efficiently ranking users based on their performance.
